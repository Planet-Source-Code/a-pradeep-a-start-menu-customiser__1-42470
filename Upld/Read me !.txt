I do not take any credit for the module, and i appreciate the work in the module ( downloaded from www.planetsourcecode.com), this is a windows tool which at times depend on the Internet Explorer being used, i suggest IE6 for this, and there are several other options which i would include after i get a job, by the way i am currently jobless and would work for food, and the internet, the required ActiveX controls for this are commondialog and microsoft tabbed dialog control 6.0, mail me at pradeep_topper@yahoo.com for any thing else
